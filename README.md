# Instructions
All the dependencies should already be included. If you are running on Linux, 
just use "dotnet build" and "dotnet run" to get it going. You need to go into 
Program.cs and change a few things to make it work.  First, the word filter 
needs to have "badword1", "badword2", etc. replaced with actual words; 
SERVIDNUMBER and CHANNELIDNUMBER need to be replaced with actual numbers;
BOT_TOKEN needs to be replaced with an actual bot token number; "RULES" and 
"STREAM TIMES" strings can be replaced with whatever you want.

# Functionality
Comes with a word filter, basic info commands, and meme/copypasta commands. 
PM's user with help and info and moves youtube links to a designated channel.
